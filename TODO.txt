***********************************************************************************************


-Change the filesystem hierarchy to match closely to that of the gnu autotools. DONE

-Fix the paths in include directives. Make them relative. DONE

-Implement enum class into DungeonTile class. Replace bools and integer constants. DONE

-Change the tile colors to make game environment seem minimalist.
		-EX: Yellow tile is now yellow outline with lighter shade of yellow. DONE

-Add loadmedia functions to sprite,DungeonTile, and DungeonMap class. DONE

-Change graphic style to pencil drawing-like style. DONE
    -Further work will be done as game comes along.
        
-Think about redefining objective of game. DONE
    -Change is needed because the game relies too much on luck when getting right key as of now. 
        -This is bad because there is no skill involved.
    -Decided to make game about finding an exit out of a labrynth with monsters in it. 

-Make gen rule for when no exits are set by setTileTypesRandom function. DONE
    -In setTileTypesRandom(), made 1st empty tile an exit instead of making a rule to check if there are exit tiles and randomly placing one.

-Fix sprite animation. Try implementing states. DONE
    -Used lazyfoo tutorial 14. 
        -Change frame after a frame count variable is incremented. 
        -Divide by number of frames used to slow down animation.
        
-Loop background music. DONE
    -Used OpenAL Soft.
    
-Add globalvariables file for directory and filepath info. DONE

-Add menus to game.Create a base menu class for easy menu creation. DONE
    -Added simple pause menu to game.
    
-Add title screen to game. DONE
    -Also created title menu class.
    

-Fix Door opening animation. Try implementing states. DONE
    -Decided to remove door opening animation because it disrupts flow of game and won't be
    needed to cover up dungeon generation b/c it will all get generated at beginning.
    
-Need to rearrange logic for loading media. DONE
    -If same media is being loaded. It shouldn't be loaded multiple times.
        -Ex: Door objects shouldn't each have a copy of same media. 
            Instead it should be loaded once and door objects would have a pointer to same media.

-Fix segmentation fault from sdl_mixer playing sound. DONE
    -Used OpenAL to play sounds and sdl mixer to only load sound media.
    
-Add randomization to choosing nodes. DONE

-Fix bug where somehow Node pointer conductorNode ends up pointing to nullptr in chooseNodesRandomly. Causes Segfault. DONE
    -Fixed by setting condition that conductor can only go back if pointer to previous node is not nullptr.
    
-Implement hash table for chossing close available node. DONE

-Implement recursive backtracking maze algorithm in labyrinth creation. DONE

-Set outer tiles at border as wall tiles. DONE
    -Created a function to set tiles at top,left,right,bottom edges as line of wall tiles.
    
-Create class for generating a map of dungeon nodes. DONE
    -Class is called dungeonMap and it takes info from all dungeon nodes created.
    -Render the nodes during labyrinth setup for debugging purposes. DONE
    
-Fix looping of door open fail sound. DONE
    -Use enum class variable to determine which sound to play.
    
-Fix collision detection with doors. DONE
    -Caused by calling for collision box for door 1 twice instead of door 1 and door 2.
    
-Add framerate cap. 60 FPS DONE
    -Made class to keep track of frame rate.
    -Not sure if should be using 2 different timers for movement and keeping track of frame rate.
        -Timer for movement gets slowed down by frame cap anyway.
        
-Make function or class in another file to keep track of globals for loading media
such as enemy media. DONE

-Create collision system for handling collisions between enemies and player. DONE

--Make state to load game resources so it doesn't happen before title state
rather after title state when player chooses to play game. DONE

-Added cockroach enemy with simple AI for now. DONE

-Abstract event handling and move implementation to another file. DONE
 
-Fix collision with doors. DONE

-Fix sound for gameover and game win states. DONE

-Fix bug with segfault caused from player being pushed out of maze. DONE

-Implement a subscreen for vague map on screen.  DONE
